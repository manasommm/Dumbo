        <p class="message">Hey Dumbo 🐒,<br><br>
            It’s been more than 15 days, 360 hours, and way too many seconds since we last talked... but who's counting? (Okay, maybe me.)<br><br>
            I know we had a minor glitch (okay, maybe a little fight), but honestly, life feels kinda incomplete without annoying you. So, instead of sending a boring text, I did what any rational person would do—built a whole website for you.<br><br>
            So… what do you say? Shall we hit the refresh button and go out for a coffee (or whatever you like)?
